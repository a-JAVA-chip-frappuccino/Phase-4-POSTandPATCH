# Phase 4 Lecture 4: POST & PATCH Requests

## Objectives

By the end of today's lecture, you will be able to create a GET route, a GET by ID route, and a DELETE route in Flask. You will also be able to name two ways to set up a cascading delete.

## Lesson Plan

0. Run `pipenv install` and `pipenv shell` to install the necessary dependencies.
1. Write a GET route to retrieve all restaurants and create an API of them.
    - What is a **GET** request?
    - Is there more than one way to do this?
2. Write a GET route to retrieve a single food_at_restaurant and create an API of it.
3. Write a DELETE request to remove a restaurant by its id.
    - What is a **DELETE** request?
    - Is there more than one way to do this as well?
    - How did we test this? What is Postman?
4. Write a DELETE request to remove a food by its id.

## Looking Ahead

Tomorrow's lesson will round out our server-side CRUD lessons, introducing POST and PATCH requests.
