## Objectives

By the end of today's lecture, you will be able to create a POST route and a PATCH route in Flask. You will also be able to add validations to models.

## Lesson Plan

1. Add validations to the models to ensure that the columns follow specific constraints.
2. Write a POST request to make a new food.
    - What is a **POST** request?
3. Write a PATCH request to update a restaurant by its id.
    - What is a **PATCH** request?

## Looking Ahead

Tomorrow's lesson will review all of the previous material in Flask and Flask-SQLAlchemy.
